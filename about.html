        <p>Global Hope Investments is was founded as a Financial & Management Accounting firm t/a Global Hope Financial Services not only did we partake in these but also have a broader perspective in Taxation assisting small and medium enterprises in these aspects. According to the research conducted we found a lot of illeteracy with most of business owners around Johannesburg they are running successful entities but they are not managed well and at the end of the day you realise they are not returning on their investment.<br><br>
            The company was initially registered in the year 2012 later took a new name Global Hope Investments because not olnly did we focus on Accounting but also IT,Transport, Retail etc.

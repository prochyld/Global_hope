        <p>We help prepare financial statements that may include monthly and annual accounts based on the information that is compiled and analyzed. The preparation of financial management reports will include accurate monthly and year-end closing documents. Reports compiled may be used in connection with the continual support and management of budgetary forecast activities.
            At Global Hope Investments we will also be responsible fully for ensuring that all financial reporting deadlines are met, internally and externally. For example, monthly, interim and annual reports all have specific deadlines, as well as some tax implications.
